/*
Problem:

Implement kReverse( int k ) in a linked list i.e. you need to reverse first K elements then reverse next k elements 
and join the linked list and so on.
Indexing starts from 0. If less than k elements left in the last, you need to reverse them as well. If k is greater 
than length of LL, reverse the complete LL.
You don't need to print the elements, just return the head of updated LL.
